want to build from nothing.
build kernal and minimum amount of functionality to run script- use as base for other installs
script that installs remainder of core tools
- primarily suckless tools, staticlly compiled binaries

further scripts to customize for each individual system

look at using modified version of [terrorshell](http://www.github.com/sww1235/terrorshell) for bashrc etc.


look at [tiny core linux](http://tinycorelinux.net/concepts.html),  [ttylinux](http://freecode.com/projects/ttylinux/) or [Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/index.html) for base OS.


Potentially look at other more mainstream OS's but make sure systemd is removable.
